# My Python Project Collection

Welcome to my collection of practical Python scripts! This repository contains a set of small, useful programs designed to showcase different programming concepts and skills.

Each project is contained within its own directory and includes its own specific README with setup and usage instructions.

## Projects Included

### 1. [File Organizer](./file-organizer/)
*   **Description:** A command-line utility that automatically organizes files in a directory into subfolders based on their file extension (e.g., `.jpg` files go into an `Images` folder, `.pdf` files go into a `Documents` folder).
*   **Concepts:** Filesystem interaction (`os`, `shutil`), command-line arguments (`argparse`), loops, and conditional logic.

### 2. [CLI Weather App](./cli-weather-app/)
*   **Description:** A command-line tool to fetch and display the current weather for any city in the world using the OpenWeatherMap API.
*   **Concepts:** Making HTTP requests (`requests`), parsing JSON data, working with APIs, environment variables, and error handling.
